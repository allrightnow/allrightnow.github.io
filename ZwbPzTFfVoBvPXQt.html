                  <p><strong>Todoist and fitness Part 3</strong> HiContinuation of a series of posts about life planning, planning and more. Links to previous posts here and here.Lose weight, build muscle, fight stress - all this you can achieve from regular sports activities. But knowing all this doesn't mean you did it. For this reason, in order to start not an easy way, this template will help. Plan and write down exercises so that you remember and follow them. Ready-made template that you can edit and use immediatelyThe template is written in Russian and will appear in the projects section when uploaded. A small tip - in order not to forget the exercise description, you can add it to the comment.Link to the template. In order to, to add it, you need the TABATA framework and Ninja comment system. Click here and then put the cursor on the ellipsoid and press ⌘ + 1 . A small tip - to mark your work with a heart, you can use ⌘ + 2 and ⌘ + 3 . Then, when finishing your comment, you can simply copy and paste it into the comment. A heart!Link to the template. In order to, to add it, you need the TABATA framework and Ninja comment system. Click here and then put the cursor on the ellipsoid and press ⌘ + 1 . A small tip - to mark your comment with a heart, you can use the arrow keys, it is written in Russian, but you can translate it to your keyboard by using the arrow keys.Unlock all the potential of your body - train with passion, not with rules. This is the mentality that greets you when you first enter the gym, but gives the result after. Regular training will quickly lead to the result, so practice after the results are achieved. A warm-up is a must!You don't have to be a genius to warm up. The main thing is to start, and then move at the first sign of difficulties. Someone once commented that warm-UPS are slow, but after warming up, they become fast. And in the end, a slow warm-up proves to be fatal. So try to start making small talk, start laughing, and move on. Start making small talk with yourself, and the coach will understand it and become your partner. This is the main mistake of novice athletes. They set too big a goal and do not give themselves enough time. It's not their fault that they come to the gym, they just came to the gym. It's not their fault that they don't have the necessary equipment. It's not their fault that they don't know how to start. There is a huge chance that you will fail miserably and completely fail, and the coach will not understand anything. Set a goal that you can achieve. When you first enter the gym,</p>
